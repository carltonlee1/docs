## General

### What is Pathfinder?

Pathfinder is an intelligent API that recommends the best LLM model and provider for your prompt, optimizing for cost, quality, and latency.

### How is this different from OpenRouter?

- **OpenRouter**: You choose the model, OpenRouter proxies the request
- **Pathfinder**: Pathfinder chooses the model for you, you execute the request

Pathfinder is a **decision service**, not a proxy.

### Do I need Pathfinder API keys AND provider API keys?

Yes. Pathfinder recommends which model to use, but you execute the completion with the provider directly. You need:
- Pathfinder API key (for routing decisions)
- Provider API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc. for executing completions)

## Privacy & Security

### Do you store my prompts?

No. We only store:
- SHA-256 hash of your prompt (irreversible)
- Extracted features (length, complexity, language)
- Selected model and cost estimates

See [Privacy-First Design](/docs/api/core-concepts/privacy-first-design) for details.

### Is my data shared with model providers?

No. Pathfinder doesn't share your data with anyone. You execute completions directly with providers using your own API keys.

### Can I use Pathfinder for HIPAA-compliant applications?

Yes, with our Enterprise plan. Contact sales@pathfinder.ai for a Business Associate Agreement (BAA).

## Pricing & Billing

### How much does Pathfinder cost?

See our pricing at https://pathfinder.ai/pricing

- **Free**: 1,000 decisions/month
- **Pro**: $49/month for 50,000 decisions
- **Enterprise**: Custom pricing

### Do I pay for the LLM completions?

Yes. Pathfinder charges for routing decisions. You pay providers separately for completions.

### Can I see how much I'm saving?

Yes. View cost analytics at https://pathfinder.ai/dashboard/analytics

## Technical

### What's the API latency?

- p95: <150ms with cache
- p99: <300ms with cache

### What providers do you support?

- OpenAI (GPT-4, GPT-3.5)
- Anthropic (Claude 3 Opus, Sonnet, Haiku)
- Google (Gemini Pro, Ultra)
- Meta (Llama 3)
- Mistral
- Cohere

See [Model Providers](/docs/api/core-concepts/model-providers) for complete list.

### Can I override Pathfinder's recommendation?

Yes. The routing decision is a recommendation. You can always choose a different model.

### What if Pathfinder recommends an unavailable model?

Use the `fallback_options` in the response. These are alternative models if the primary fails.

## Integration

### Do you have an SDK?

No SDK needed. Use any HTTP client (requests, fetch, cURL, etc.).

### Can I use Pathfinder with LangChain?

Yes. Create a custom LangChain component that calls Pathfinder for model selection.

### Does Pathfinder work with streaming?

Yes. Pathfinder recommends the model. You implement streaming with the provider's API.

## Troubleshooting

### I'm getting 401 Unauthorized

Check your API key:
1. Copy from https://pathfinder.ai/dashboard/api-keys
2. Ensure it starts with `sk_live_` or `sk_test_`
3. Use Bearer token format: `Authorization: Bearer sk_live_...`

### I'm getting 429 Rate Limit Exceeded

You've exceeded your plan's rate limit:
1. Respect the `retry_after` value
2. Implement exponential backoff
3. Upgrade your plan at https://pathfinder.ai/pricing

### My prompt is being rejected

Common issues:
- Prompt exceeds 100,000 characters (truncate it)
- Invalid JSON (check syntax)
- Invalid constraints (ensure positive floats)
