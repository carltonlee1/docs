## Overview

API keys authenticate your applications with the Pathfinder routing API. Each key is scoped to your organization and can be revoked at any time.

## Creating an API Key

1. Navigate to **API Keys** in the sidebar
2. Click **Create New Key**
3. Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "Production Backend", "Development")
4. Click **Create**

**Important**: Copy and save your API key immediately. For security, the full key is only shown once.

## Key Format

API keys follow this format:
```
sk_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

- `sk_` - Prefix indicating a secret key
- `live_` - Environment (live for production)
- `xxxx...` - Unique identifier

## Managing Keys

### View All Keys

The API Keys page shows all keys for your organization:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Name** | Descriptive name you provided |
| **Key Hint** | Last 4 characters for identification |
| **Created** | When the key was created |
| **Last Used** | Most recent API call with this key |
| **Status** | Active or Revoked |

### Revoke a Key

To revoke a compromised or unused key:

1. Find the key in the list
2. Click the **...** menu
3. Select **Revoke**
4. Confirm the action

**Warning**: Revoking a key is immediate and cannot be undone. Any applications using the key will stop working.

### Rotate a Key

To rotate a key without downtime:

1. Create a new key with the same permissions
2. Update your application to use the new key
3. Verify the new key works
4. Revoke the old key

## Best Practices

### Security

- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use environment variables to store keys
- Rotate keys periodically (every 90 days recommended)
- Use separate keys for development and production

### Environment Variables

```bash
# .env file (never commit this!)
PATHFINDER_API_KEY=sk_live_abc123...
```

```python
import os

api_key = os.environ.get("PATHFINDER_API_KEY")
```

### Key Naming

Use descriptive names to identify key usage:

| Name | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| `production-backend` | Main production API server |
| `staging-backend` | Staging environment |
| `local-dev-alice` | Alice's local development |
| `ci-cd-pipeline` | Automated testing |

## Usage Monitoring

Track API key usage from the dashboard:

1. Click on any key name
2. View usage statistics:
   - Total requests
   - Requests per day/week/month
   - Error rate
   - Average latency

## Rate Limits

API keys share your organization's rate limits:

| Tier | Requests/second | Requests/day |
|------|-----------------|--------------|
| Free | 10 | 1,000 |
| Pro | 100 | 100,000 |
| Enterprise | Custom | Custom |
