## Export Data

Export analytics for external analysis:

1. Select time range
2. Click **Export**
3. Choose format:
   - **CSV** - For spreadsheets
   - **JSON** - For programmatic access
   - **PDF** - For reports

[Screenshot placeholder: Export options]

## Setting Up Alerts

Configure alerts for anomalies:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Alerts**
2. Create alert rules:
   - Cost exceeds threshold
   - Error rate spikes
   - Latency increases

[Screenshot placeholder: Alert configuration]

## Best Practices

### Regular Review

- Review analytics weekly to identify trends
- Compare week-over-week costs
- Monitor for error rate increases

### Optimization Opportunities

Use analytics to find:

1. **Over-routing to premium models**: If quality_first is used too often, consider adjusting policies
2. **High error rates**: Investigate specific models or providers
3. **Cost spikes**: Identify prompts causing high costs

### A/B Testing

Compare routing strategies:

1. Run 50% traffic with `cost_optimized`
2. Run 50% traffic with `balanced`
3. Compare quality feedback after 1 week
