## Welcome to Pathfinder

Pathfinder is an intelligent API that routes prompts to the optimal language model based on cost, capability, and performance.

Instead of choosing a model yourself, you send Pathfinder your prompt and it automatically recommends the best model and provider for your use case.

### Key Benefits

- **Cost Optimization**: Save up to 70% on API costs by routing to cheaper models without sacrificing quality
- **Automatic Failover**: If your preferred provider is down, Pathfinder routes to a backup automatically
- **Privacy First**: Your raw prompts are never stored—only anonymized hashes and features
- **Multi-Tenant**: Complete isolation between organizations with row-level security
- **Real-Time Insights**: Track which models work best for your use cases

### How It Works

```
1. You send a prompt → 2. Pathfinder analyzes it → 3. Returns best model/provider → 4. You execute with that provider
```

**Important**: Pathfinder decides which model to use, but you execute the actual completion with that provider's API.

### What You Get Back

A routing decision that includes:
- **Selected Model**: Which model to use (e.g., `gpt-4-turbo`)
- **Provider**: Which company to call (e.g., `openai`)
- **Confidence**: How confident we are (0.0-1.0)
- **Estimated Cost**: How much this will cost
- **Fallback Options**: Alternative models if primary fails
- **Reasoning**: Why we picked this model

### Common Use Cases

| Use Case | What Pathfinder Does |
|----------|---------------------|
| **Cost-sensitive app** | Routes to cheaper models while maintaining quality |
| **High-reliability system** | Provides fallback models if primary provider fails |
| **Multi-user SaaS** | Optimizes cost per user while maintaining user experience |
| **Research/Benchmarking** | Helps identify which models work best for different tasks |

### A 5-Minute Example

```bash
# 1. Send your prompt to Pathfinder
curl -X POST https://api.pathfinder.ai/v1/routes:decide \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_live_abc123..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "Write a Python function to..."
  }'

# 2. Get back routing decision
{
  "decision_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "selected_model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview",
  "provider": "openai",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "estimated_cost_usd": 0.015,
  "reasoning": "GPT-4 Turbo selected for coding task"
}

# 3. Use the decision to call OpenAI
# (Use openai-python SDK or similar with the model above)
```

### Privacy & Security

Pathfinder is built on privacy-first principles:

- ✅ **Raw prompts never stored** - Only SHA-256 hashes
- ✅ **Feature extraction only** - We analyze length, complexity, language
- ✅ **Tenant isolation** - Your data is completely isolated from other users
- ✅ **No third-party sharing** - We don't share your data with model providers
- ✅ **Audit logging** - All decisions logged for your compliance needs

## FAQ

**How is this different from OpenRouter?**
OpenRouter lets you choose between models. Pathfinder automatically chooses for you based on your constraints and policies, optimizing for cost/quality/latency.

**Can I override Pathfinder's decision?**
Yes! The routing decision is a recommendation. You can always choose a different model. See [Manual Override Guide](/docs/api/guides/manual-overrides).

**What about my data privacy?**
Your raw prompts are never stored. Only anonymized hashes and extracted features. See our [Privacy Policy](https://pathfinder.ai/privacy).

**Do you support all models?**
We support all major models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and others. See [Available Models](/docs/api/api-reference/models-list).
